    <p>
      Welcome to ClawBox, operated by Team Learners Inc. (operating as "Artificial General
      Intelligence Team" on Google Play). By using our mobile application and related services, you
      agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use
      our services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>
      ClawBox provides a personal AI assistant accessible through messaging platforms such as
      Telegram. We create and manage AI-powered bot instances on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>
      You must sign in using a Google or Apple account. You are responsible for maintaining the
      security of your account and for all activities that occur under it.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Access to ClawBox requires an active subscription purchased through the Apple App Store or
        Google Play Store.
      </li>
      <li>
        Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the
        current billing period.
      </li>
      <li>
        Payment is charged to your App Store or Google Play account at confirmation of purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device's subscription settings.
      </li>
      <li>Refunds are subject to the policies of Apple or Google, as applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, hack, or disrupt the service</li>
      <li>Share your bot token or account credentials with unauthorized parties</li>
      <li>Use the AI assistant to generate harmful, abusive, or misleading content</li>
      <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. AI-Generated Content and Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Responses from the AI assistant are generated by third-party AI models and may not always be
      accurate. We do not guarantee the correctness, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated
      content. You are solely responsible for how you use such content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you use the chat feature, your messages and any image attachments are transmitted to
      <strong>OpenRouter</strong> and subsequently forwarded to third-party AI model providers (such
      as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) to generate responses. By using the chat feature, you
      acknowledge and consent to this data transmission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do not submit sensitive personal information</strong> (such as financial details,
      government IDs, health records, or passwords) through the chat feature. We cannot guarantee
      the confidentiality of data transmitted to third-party AI providers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Instance Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>
      AI instances are created upon subscription activation and may be automatically removed when
      your subscription is no longer active. We are not responsible for data loss resulting from
      instance deletion.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      ClawBox integrates with third-party services including Telegram, Google, Apple, RevenueCat,
      and OpenRouter. Your use of these services is subject to their respective terms and policies.

      indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service.

      preceding the claim.
    </p>

      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these
      Terms. You may delete your account at any time from within the app, which will permanently
      remove all associated data.
